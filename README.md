## Inspiration

The Safe Camp app is a project made for the [Backyard Hacks hackathon](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/3466-backyardhacks) organized by [MLH Summer League](https://mlh.io/)

While in a camp or our backyard, we can come across lots of mysterious plants and animals. But we are not sure who is poisonous or safe for our interaction with them. So we decided to make an app that can detect for *[poisonivy](https://g.co/kgs/Wj5XMo)* and *snakes* by uploading photos to the app. 
**Camp Safe not Snake!**

## What it does

The Safe Camp app provides lots of features to its users. It can detect for **poison ivy and snakes** using photos you upload in the app. What it does is, scans the photo and uses machine learning for the detection. To know more about the backend you can skip to [How we built it part](). Our app can show the **day, weather, temperature, UV index** and **air quality of your location** (needs access to your location settings on your phone).

## Challenges we faced

Together we can face any challenges as deep as the ocean and as high as the sky. - Sonia Gandhi

We came across a numerous amount of challenges throughout this weekend for this project. Firstly, the basic setup of dependencies and the environment for React Native took us a while. After that we faced an issue regarding the configuring of a phone camera for our app, causing us to create the React Native application over again as some dependencies were corrupt. Furthermore, there was a problem with hitting an endpoint to post an image. The version of the react-native we were using didn't support what we were trying to do. We also faced tons of problems in our backend and setups.

But in the end, our perseverance and hard work as a team made this app a success. Here are a few achievements we are proud of while fixing challenging issues.

## Accomplishemnts we're proud of

First of all, this whole journey of attending the backyard hacks hackathon, the various workshops as well as interacting with so cool coders and mentors, was an accomplishment in itself. 

We are proud of our consistent support to each other in the team as well as helping each other in their field of works.

Our biggest accomplishment was to make the React Native app to get to work. It was our first React Native project after all. We were able to successfully hit multiple endpoints getting weather date at the user's location. 

We are proud to be able to make a user-friendly app that anyone can use to have safe camping.
