## Inspiration

The Safe Camp app is a project made for the [Backyard Hacks hackathon](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/3466-backyardhacks) organized by [MLH Summer League](https://mlh.io/)

While in a camp or our backyard, we can come across lots of mysterious plants and animals. But we are not sure who are poisonous or safe for our interaction with them. So we decided to make an app which can detect for *[poisonivy](https://g.co/kgs/Wj5XMo)* and *snakes* by uploading photos to the app. 
**Camp Safe not Snake!**

## What it does

The Safe Camp app provides lots of features to it's users. It can detect for **poisonivy and snakes** using photos you upload in the app. What it does is, scans the photo and uses machine learning for the detection. To know more about the backend you can skip to [How we built it part](). Our app can show the **day, weather, temperature, UV index** and **air quality of your location** (needs access to your location settings on your phone).
